# Overview

This program has been designed to be a useful, all-encompassing gradebook that can be saved, have new data uploaded, and data deleted. I have created this as my first experience coding with Java in order to get a good feel for all that Java has to offer, including using variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, ArrayLists, reading and writing to a file, and more.


The software I wrote is a gradebook that can be reasonably be used to keep track of students and assignments. The user is able to create a new gradebook file, allowing for multiple classes if they desire. They are also able to add grades, delete grades, and calculate a student's total score for the class.


This software was written to be an introduction for myself to the world of Java programming. I also wanted to create something useful and intuitive. This program is a result of that effort.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

The tools I used to develop this software include Microsoft Visual Studio and GitHub.

In the development of this program, I used the Java programming language, with the following libraries: ArrayList, Scanner, File, IOException, FileWriter, and FileNotFoundException.

# Future Work

- This program will need a better user interface in order to be more user-friendly.
- The students will need to each be given their own ArrayList so that the data can be cleaner and not all compiled into one large String ArrayList.
- I will need to clean up the code and minimize the amount of files being used.
